This repository is an adaptation from the epsilonorion roscopter version.  This version of roscopter is for the Olin College of Engineering and Ocean Alliance "SnotBot" project.

The goal of the project is to control one or multiple multirotors during an autonomous marine mission to collect whale snot.  

The adjustments to Roscopter made in this repo version include specific scripts to control multirotors with specific behaviors of interest, and scripts to launch multiple air vehicles at once.

This is currently a work in progress.  For specific downloading instructions, we recommend using the epsilonorion repository.
